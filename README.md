# Language-Detection

**Key Features:**

_Text Preprocessing_: The framework includes text preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming to prepare the textual data for language detection. This ensures the quality and consistency of input data for accurate language identification.

_Feature Extraction_: Utilizing techniques like CountVectorizer, the framework extracts features from text data, transforming it into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms.

_Machine Learning Models_: The framework implements various machine learning models to classify text data into different languages. These models are trained on labeled datasets to learn the language patterns and make predictions on unseen text.

**Technologies Used:**

1) Python
2) pandas
3) NumPy
4) NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
5) scikit-learn
